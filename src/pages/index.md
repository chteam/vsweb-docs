## Visual Studio 中的 Web 开发

Visual Studio 提供最好的 web、设备以及云端的集成开发环境。

Features like [IntelliSense](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532997), [Browser Link](http://www.asp.net/visual-studio/overview/2013/using-browser-link), [snippets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms165392.aspx), and [debuggers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms165008.aspx) work with the languages and frameworks of your choice.  Be more productive developing in [HTML, JavaScript, and CSS as well as the .NET languages](/languages/).  Use the [web development frameworks](/frameworks/) of your choice, including Angular, Knockout, and Bootstrap on the client, PHP, Django, and ASP.NET on the server, and many others.

For source control Visual Studio has [Git](https://www.visualstudio.com/get-started/code/share-your-code-in-git-vs) as well as [TFVC (TFS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/get-started/code/share-your-code-in-tfvc-vs) support built-in.  And the  NuGet, Bower, and npm [package managers](/package-managers/) make it easy to leverage open source packages in your applications.

For teams working across multiple platforms, Visual Studio provides a flexible collaboration environment that welcomes connection with other development tools,  such as Eclipse and Xcode.
